                  Woahh...Yet another masterpiece from Devanshu Singh . <br><br>
                  As always Vikrant Massey again steals the stage single handedly but this time it was tough to say he alone left the audience blank to say something for their superb act.<br><br>
                  Kriti Kharbanda as usual made her act over dramatic at the end of the story but was not so noticeable cause she acted decently throughtout the movie .<br><br>
                  The supporting lead also worked fluently ; Gauahar Khan & Jameel Khan were perfect fit for their roles , apart from them each and every character showed maturity and sensibility with their roles even it is a 30 second role .<br><br>
                  The casting was picture perfect and the talent of actors itself made the movie beautiful .<br><br>

                  Script was above average and the story was somewhere unnecessarily dragged but it was Okay as the story completed within 2 hrs .<br><br>
                  The only thing I didn't liked was they completed their College Romance with a single song "Hum Dono Yun Mile" , i believe if the college romance could have given us something more about them then it woulb be great but nevertheless they very efficiently showed their college life through 3-5 minute song .
                  <br><br>

                  I would definitely ask you to binge watch 14 Phere over Hungama 2 <br>
                  Cheers <br><br>
